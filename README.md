# Cables-Grading-Calculator-based-on-C#

Grading of cable is the process of achieving uniform distribution of dielectric stress or voltage gradient in a dielectric of cable. Voltage gradient or dielectric stress is maximum at the surface of the conductor and minimum at the inner surface of a sheath.

The program can calculate both Capacitance Grading and Intersheath Grading.
No installation is needed, just run the executable file cables_grading.exe
